**How is an assessment linked to the Care Plan?**

Each of those first 8 areas under "Assess and Plan" has 4 quick sections:

1. Needs Assessment (an overview of the client's needs)
2. Assessment Summary and Outcomes (how your team can support the client, and any goals)
3. Tasks (to achieve these goals)
4. Risks & Mitigations (for your team to be aware of)

This provides an easy aand clear link from the assessment area to the wider Care Plan as a whole. In addition, many agencies provide care as part of reablement packages, supporting clients to regain pre-admission levels of independence and function. As part of this, reablement packages often require care agencies to have a section for Goals, Outcomes or Achievements. By using Birdie Assessments, Care Managers can include everything in one process, saving time and making required information transparent.
